    <p><h1>Task 1 --> An instance of class Movie represents a film.</h1>  
         
        <h2>Conditions</h2>
       <h4>
        a) Write a constructor for the class Movie, <br> 
        which takes a String representing the title of the movie, 
        a String representing the studio, and a String representing <br>
        the rating as its arguments, and sets the 
        respective class properties to these values. <br><br>
        
        b) The constructor for the class Movie will set 
        the class property rating to "PG" as default when no rating is provided. <br><br>
        
        c) Write a method getPG, which takes an array of 
        base type Movie as its argument, <br>and returns a 
        new array of only those movies in the input array 
        with a rating of "PG". <br> You may assume the input 
        array is full of Movie instances. The returned array need not be full. <br><br>
        
        d) Write a piece of code that creates an instance of the
         class Movie with <br>the title “Casino Royale”, 
         the studio “Eon Productions”, and the rating “PG­13” </h4></p>
